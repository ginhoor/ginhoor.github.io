-   #### Create a repository

    Head over to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [create a new repository](https://github.com/new) named *username*.github.io, where *username* is your username (or organization name) on GitHub.

    If the first part of the repository doesn’t exactly match your username, it won’t work, so make sure to get it right.
